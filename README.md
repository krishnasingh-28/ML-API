# ML-API
**Training a ML model as a web api using (fastapi)** 

# Project Aim ðŸŽ¯

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Demonstrate end-to-end workflow** from model training to API deployment.  
- **Teach model serialization**: how to save (`pickle`) and load a scikit-learn model for inference.  
- **Build FastAPI endpoints** for:
  - Single prediction
  - Batch prediction  
  with **Pydantic validation** for input handling.  
- **Leverage auto-generated docs (Swagger UI)** for testing and clarity.  
- **Provide a reusable template** for productionizing ML models beyond Jupyter notebooks.  
- **Highlight practical testing** using:
  - `requests` library
  and **development with auto-reload** for faster iterations.
